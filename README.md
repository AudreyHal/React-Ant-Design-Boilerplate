# React-Ant-Design-Boilerplate
This project is a simple boilerplate for using antd with create-react-app. It lets you override create-react-app webpack configs without ejecting. https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app

Go to the project directory and run :

### `yarn`

Installs the project dependencies <br />

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run :

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`
